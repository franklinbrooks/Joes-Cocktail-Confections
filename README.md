### About The Project
A couple paragraphs about the general approach.
Who are users, what do they want, and why?
In the world of confectionary arts, there is a Harlem-born entrepreneur looking for a way to make it easier to organize and record his orders as well as easier for his customers to make orders. Currently, the only web presence for this business owner consists of social media sites (i.e. instagram and facebook) where his clientele places orders through calling him directly.  This is where our team stepped in to assist with this endeavor and help a local NYC business owner.  As lovers of baked goods ourselves, our team set out to share that love by building a website as an extension to his brand and to showcase his work.  What makes his business unique?  His specialties are alcohol infused baked goods and custom-made to user specification.  Our efforts were focused on giving his current customer base an easier way to view his products and make orders. As more features are added, it could possibly grow his traffic, lead volume, and increase his customer base.

Our approach for this website was to build for mobile first since majority of customers are reached on the go, as he markets his brand at social after-hour events. The targeted users are extroverted people who like to host social gatherings and events. These users need a quick way to view product offerings and have a visual representation of those products.

- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Express.js
- Postgres SQL
- Sass CSS
- Materialize
- Serialize ORM
- Bcrypt

### Installation instructions for dependencies
This project includes a package.JSON file which provides details for the above dependencies and others.  These files are imported into the node_modules folder by Node Package Manager. One Ruby gem enables transpiling of Sass to CSS.  Finally, Font-Awesome and Materialize-CSS are linked via CDN.

### Code Example Quote
```javascript
/* Creating Order - Add to Order Button  */
router.post('/newOrder', authHelpers.loginRequired, (req, res, next)  => {
  orderHelpers.createOrder(req, res)
  .then((order) => {
      res.redirect('/order');
    })
    .catch((err) => { res.status(500).json({ status: 'error' });
  })
});

### Build Strategy
.....A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took...
We 


### Contributing
This project was developed as part of the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly in NYC, February 2017. Our mentors for this build were Kate, Ariana, and Vince. Thanks, all!

### Minimum Viable Product
- Use PostgreSQL & Express to build full stack web app
- Should include TWO related models, one of which should be a user model.
- Include all major CRUD functions for at least one of those models
- Add an Authentication layer to your app to restrict access to appropriate users
- Craft thoughtful user stories together as a team, displaying them on a ZenHub board
- Manage team contributions and collaboration using the Git workflow
- Layout and style your front-end, so that is Responsive and uses a CSS Framework
- Deploy your application online so it's publicly accessible

### Improvements on MVP
- When user places an order it sends an email to customer and business owner that the order has been placed. We implement this functionality with Nodemailer.

### Unsolved problems or major hurdles team had to overcome
- We had to build the database in the beginning and make small additions to the database as we realized more information was needed. We learned how important that planning 
step in building the back-end was in this project. We overcame that challenge and even added additional columns for future applications.
- Working on way to allow user to update password so that it goes through hashing process again

### Possible Future Improvements
In no particular order, we would like to add
  1. Addition of User invoicing via third-party payment API
  2. User will be able to review past order history by delivery dates.
  3. Add Status updates for orders through implementation of SMS services like Twilio, etc.
  3. Ability for Admin login
